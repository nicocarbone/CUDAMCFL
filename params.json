The code is based on previous work by Alerstam et al and Wang et al, with the addition of a voxelized medium without symmetries and with an inhomogeneous distribution of absorbers and fluorescent markers.\r\n\r\nBroadly speaking, the code developed in the present contribution adds over CUDAMC:\r\n\r\n* A complete Cartesian geometry, without assumptions of symmetry, producing x,y Cartesian images as output.\r\n* Inhomogeneities embedded in the medium, defined by an input matrix.\r\n* A voxelization of the bulk media, for inhomogeneity description and for photon hitting density storage.\r\n* The possibility of a isotropic source located anywhere in the medium.\r\n* Fluorescent sources simulation.\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nNicolás Abel Carbone\r\n\r\nInstituto de Física Arroyo Seco – IFAS (UNCPBA) and CIFICEN (UNCPBA-CICPBA-CONICET), Pinto 399, 7000) Tandil, Argentina\r\n\r\nncarbone@exa.unicen.edu.ar",
